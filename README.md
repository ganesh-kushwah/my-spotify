we will build a music search engine using React and the Spotify API. Our app will allow users to search for songs and retrieve 30-second song previews. We will start by creating a new React project and installing the necessary packages. Then, we will explore the Spotify Web API and learn how to make API calls from our React app. We will use the search endpoint to retrieve song data and the player endpoint to play song previews.
